# 🧠 Medical Image Tamper Detection  
_Project Repository for Modelos y Simulaciones II_

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect tampered medical images (deepfakes) using Machine Learning techniques, with a special focus on CT (Computed Tomography) scans. The dataset used is **"Deepfakes: Medical Image Tamper Detection (CT-GAN)"**, which contains altered and original medical images, essential for preserving diagnostic integrity in healthcare environments.

📄 First phase includes a PDF document containing:
- Theoretical framework.
- State of the art with a review of specialized literature.

⚙️ In the second phase, experiments related to the detection of manipulated medical images were conducted, which are located in the /Codigos folder in notebooks 01 to 05. The procedures and results were documented in the written report in PDF format.
  
> ⚠️ **Note**: To reproduce notebooks 01 and 02, it is necessary to have the folder containing the CT scans. Therefore, these notebooks cannot be reproduced unless the missing files are added.
