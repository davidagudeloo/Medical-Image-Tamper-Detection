# 🧠 Medical Image Tamper Detection  
_Project Repository for Modelos y Simulaciones II_

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect tampered medical images (deepfakes) using Machine Learning techniques, with a special focus on CT (Computed Tomography) scans. The dataset used is **"Deepfakes: Medical Image Tamper Detection (CT-GAN)"**, which contains altered and original medical images, essential for preserving diagnostic integrity in healthcare environments.

📄 This first phase includes a PDF document containing:
- Theoretical framework.
- State of the art with a review of specialized literature.
  
> ⚠️ **Note**: Code development and models will be included in the upcoming project phases.
